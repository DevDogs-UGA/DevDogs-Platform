# What is DevDogs "Platform?"
DevDogs' open-source, internal backend powers the DevDogs website, Discord Bot, and other end-user experiences. This component of the DevDogs System* is **not** open to member contributions. It is strictly developed by the Lead Web Developer and Executive Board members.

The DevDogs Platform provides API endpoints securely exposing contribution, attendance, demographic, and user data to the website and "RoboDog" interfaces. It also computes this data into meaningful analytics, supporting executive, faculty, and corporate decisions.

*The DevDogs System is a collection of inward and external-facing tools for administering and maintaining involvement in DevDogs. It includes the DevDogs Website, RoboDog Discord Bot, and DevDogs Platform, which power the two.
